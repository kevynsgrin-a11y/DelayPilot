/**
 * INTERIM VIEW-MODEL TYPES for the composed patterns — to be replaced by `packages/contracts`.
 *
 * `packages/contracts` is Phase 2 work owned by `principal-architect` and does not exist yet, but
 * the patterns in this directory have to name a segment, a transfer component, a rights line and a
 * risk band at the type level today. `AGENTS.md §5.1` forbids inventing a parallel shape for an
 * upstream contract, so — following the precedent already set by
 * `packages/ui/src/tokens/interim-contracts.ts` — these are declared as narrowly as possible,
 * consumed only by this directory and by `apps/web/src/demo`, and marked for deletion.
 *
 * HANDOFF FILED: `to: principal-architect` — publish `Segment`, `Snapshot`, `Provenance`,
 * `ConnectionAssessment`, `TransferComponent`, `RightsAssessment`, `ActionItem` and `AlertEvent`
 * from `packages/contracts` in Phase 2. When they land, delete this file and re-point
 * `packages/ui/src/patterns/**` at the contract. Nothing here is re-exported as the public API of a
 * second package in the meantime.
 *
 * The vocabulary is not invented either: the five rights statuses are `AGENTS.md §1.3`, the six
 * provenance kinds are `AGENTS.md §1.2`, the five result bands are `DIRECTIVE.md §27`, and the
 * transfer components and derivation classes are the `.claude/agents/frontend-ui-engineer.md`
 * connection-cockpit contract (`T = T_deplane + T_walk + T_security + T_immigration + T_bag +
 * T_mobility + T_uncertainty`, each with its derivation class).
